## 🚀 Quick Start

### Quick Setup

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
mkdir -p notediscovery/data && cd notediscovery
docker run -d --name notediscovery -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/gamosoft/notediscovery:latest
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
mkdir notediscovery\data; cd notediscovery
docker run -d --name notediscovery -p 8000:8000 `
  -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data `
  ghcr.io/gamosoft/notediscovery:latest
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** — done! 🎉  


> 💡 Your notes are saved in `./data/`. Themes, plugins, locales and default configuration values are included in the image.

### Using Docker Compose

Two docker-compose files are provided:

| File | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` | **Recommended** - Uses pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry |
| `docker-compose.yml` | For development - Builds from local source |

**Option 1: Pre-built image (fastest)**

Linux/macOS:
```bash
mkdir -p notediscovery/data && cd notediscovery
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamosoft/notediscovery/main/docker-compose.ghcr.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
mkdir notediscovery\data; cd notediscovery
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamosoft/notediscovery/main/docker-compose.ghcr.yml -OutFile docker-compose.ghcr.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d
```

**Option 2: Build from source (for development)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gamosoft/notediscovery.git
cd notediscovery
docker-compose up -d
```

See [Advanced Docker Setup](#advanced-docker-setup) for volume details.


### Running Locally (Without Docker)

For development or if you prefer running directly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gamosoft/notediscovery.git
cd notediscovery

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python run.py

# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

#### Using Virtual Environments (Recommended for Arch/Fedora/Ubuntu 23.04+)

Modern Linux distributions enforce [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/), which prevents system-wide pip installs. Use a virtual environment instead:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gamosoft/notediscovery.git
cd notediscovery

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (choose your shell):
source venv/bin/activate        # Bash/Zsh (most Linux distros)
source venv/bin/activate.fish   # Fish (CachyOS, etc.)
source venv/bin/activate.csh    # Csh/Tcsh
.\venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows PowerShell

# Install dependencies and run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> *You'll need to activate the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate) each time you open a new terminal before running the app*

### Advanced Docker Setup

The image includes bundled config, themes, plugins, and locales. To customize, you must:
1. **Map the volume** in your docker-compose or docker run command
2. **Provide content** - the file/folder must exist with valid content (empty = app might break!)

| Volume | Purpose | Bundled? |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `data/` | Your notes | ❌ You must create |
| `config.yaml` | App settings | ✅ Yes |
| `themes/` | Custom themes | ✅ Yes |
| `plugins/` | Custom plugins | ✅ Yes |
| `locales/` | Translations | ✅ Yes |

## 🌍 Multiple Languages

NoteDiscovery supports multiple languages! Currently available:
- 🇺🇸 English (en-US) - Default
- 🇪🇸 Español (es-ES)
- 🇩🇪 Deutsch (de-DE)
- 🇫🇷 Français (fr-FR)

**To change language:** Go to Settings (gear icon) → Language dropdown.

**To add your own language:** See the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#-contributing-translations) for instructions on creating translation files.

**Docker users:** Mount your custom locales folder to add or override translations:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./locales:/app/locales  # Custom translations
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you clone this repository, you can mount the `documentation/` folder to view these docs inside the app:

```yaml
# In your docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data              # Your personal notes
  - ./documentation:/app/data/docs:ro  # Mount docs subfolder inside the data folder (read-only)
```

Then access them at `http://localhost:8000` - the docs will appear as a `docs/` folder in the file browser!

## 🤝 Contributing

**Before submitting a pull request**, especially for major changes, please:
- Read our **[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)**
- Open an issue first to discuss major features or significant changes
- Ensure your code follows the project's style and philosophy


## 🔒 Security Considerations

NoteDiscovery is designed for **self-hosted, private use**. Please keep these security considerations in mind:

### Network Security
- ⚠️ **Do NOT expose directly to the internet** without additional security measures
- Run behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with HTTPS for production use
- Keep it on your local network or use a VPN for remote access
- By default, the app listens on `0.0.0.0:8000` (all network interfaces)

### Authentication
- **Password protection is DISABLED by default** (default password: `admin`)
- ⚠️ **ENABLE AUTHENTICATION AND CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD** if exposing to a network!
- See **[AUTHENTICATION.md](documentation/AUTHENTICATION.md)** for complete setup instructions
- To disable auth, set `authentication.enabled: false` in `config.yaml`
- Change password with Docker: `docker-compose exec notediscovery python generate_password.py`
- Perfect for single-user or small team deployments
- For multi-user setups, consider a reverse proxy with OAuth/SSO

### Data Privacy
- Your notes are stored as **plain text markdown files** in the `data/` folder
- No data is sent to external services
- Regular backups are recommended

### Best Practices
- Run on `localhost` or a private network only
- Use Docker for isolation and easier security management
- Keep your system and dependencies updated
- Review and audit any plugins you install
- Set appropriate file permissions on the `data/` directory

**TL;DR**: Perfect for personal use on your local machine or home network. Enable built-in password protection if needed, or use a reverse proxy with authentication if exposing to wider networks.
